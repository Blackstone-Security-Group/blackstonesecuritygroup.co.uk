# BLACKSTONE SECURITY GROUP - OPERATIONAL CAMPAIGN BRIEF – Revenant

**Campaign Name: Operation Iron Eclipse**  
**Commissioning Entity:** United Nations Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Africa (UNREC)  
**Location: Democratic Republic of Congo** (DRC)  
**Mission Type: Covert Counter-Arms Trafficking Operations**  
**Operational Mandate:** Disrupt, dismantle, and eliminate illegal arms networks while maintaining plausible deniability for UNREC. Operations such as Revenant Storm will underscore how firearms trafficking represents a grave transnational threat, facilitating the activities of organized crime networks and terrorist groups.

## I. Strategic Overview
The Democratic Republic of Congo remains a key transit hub for illicit arms trafficking, fueling regional instability, insurgencies, and warlord activities. Despite official peacekeeping efforts, major arms networks continue to thrive. **Blackstone Security Group** has been covertly contracted to conduct **Extreme high-risk, deniable operations** to weaken these networks, disrupt supply chains, and bolster border security—without direct attribution to UN forces.
The campaign is structured into six sequential operations, each targeting a critical aspect of the arms trade in the region.

## II. OPERATION FRAMEWORK
### 1. OPERATION NIGHTFALL (Direct Action: Targeted Raids & Network Disruption)
**Objective:** Conduct coordinated strikes against known arms traffickers and disrupt their supply lines.  
**Key Actions:**  
- Gather **SIGINT/HUMINT** on arms shipments and trafficking routes.
- Conduct **high-risk night raids** on major trafficking hubs in Kinshasa and Goma.
- Capture or eliminate high-value targets (HVTs) within identified arms syndicates.
- Recover and analyse intelligence for follow-on operations.
Expected Outcome: Severely disrupt network logistics and identify deeper connections.

### 2. OPERATION SILENT THUNDER (Sabotage & Depot Neutralization)
**Objective:** Destroy illegal arms depots and caches before they can be distributed.  
**Key Actions:**  
- Locate hidden **arms dumps and black-market warehouses** using UAV and ground reconnaissance.
- Conduct **precision demolition** of stockpiles with minimal collateral damage.
- Plant **false evidence** to misdirect investigations towards rival groups.
- Intercept and sabotage arms convoys before they reach key warlords and militias.

**Expected Outcome: Immediate reduction in available arms stock for local insurgencies.**

### 3. OPERATION IRON GATE (Strengthening Border Security & Patrols)
**Objective:** Reinforce key border crossings to intercept illicit arms smuggling.  
**Key Actions:**  
- Establish **covert monitoring stations** at high-traffic border points (DRC-CAR, DRC-Uganda, DRC-Rwanda).
- Set up **mobile interception teams** to catch high-value shipments in transit.
- Deploy **drones and reconnaissance assets** to track cross-border smuggling routes.

**Expected Outcome: Disrupt trafficking at key transit points and improve interdiction capabilities.**

### 4. OPERATION VIPER STRIKE (Targeted Seizures & Security Operations)
**Objective:** Execute precision strikes on arms shipments and seize illegal weapon stockpiles.  
**Key Actions:**  
- Conduct **covert ambushes** on smuggling convoys and river transport routes.
- Secure and extract **illicit weapons for forensic tracing**.
- Expose **links between traffickers and corrupt officials** to sow distrust within networks.
- Reallocate seized arms to trusted local security forces for controlled use.

**Expected Outcome: Reduce illegal arms in circulation while using seized intelligence for deeper network penetration.**

### 5. OPERATION BLACK PYTHON (Supporting Local Security Forces & Proxy Engagements)
**Objective:** Strengthen local capacity to sustain counter-trafficking efforts.  
**Key Actions:**  
- Provide **advanced tactical training** to select government and security forces.
- Establish **joint task forces** with vetted military and police units.
- Deploy **advisory teams** to coordinate future anti-trafficking missions.
- Ensure **on-ground influence** without direct Blackstone attribution.

**Expected Outcome: Empower local forces to maintain momentum after Blackstone’s exit.**

### 6. OPERATION VEILBREAKER (Final Network Dismantling & Exit Strategy)
**Objective:** Conduct final wave of takedowns on surviving traffickers and close operations.  
**Key Actions:**  
- Use **intelligence from previous operations** to conduct final raids on remaining players.
- Leak controlled **disinformation** to dismantle any lingering criminal alliances.
- Create **false narratives** to shift blame onto rival factions, ensuring lasting disruption.
- Conduct a **phased withdrawal**, leaving no trace of Blackstone’s involvement.

**Expected Outcome: Permanent disruption of illegal arms flow with no attribution to UNREC or Blackstone.**

## III. OPERATIONAL RISKS & CHALLENGES
- Hostile Forces: Militia groups, corrupt officials, and cartel-backed traffickers may retaliate.
- Political Sensitivity: UN cannot be publicly linked to Blackstone’s actions.
- Operational Security: Intelligence leaks or failed missions could expose the covert nature of the campaign.
- Collateral Damage: Civilian casualties must be minimized to avoid backlash.

## IV. SUCCESS CRITERIA
- 75%+ reduction in illicit arms flow through key transit routes.
- Destruction of three or more major arms depots.
- Neutralization of high-value traffickers responsible for arms trade.
- Strengthened local forces capable of continuing interdiction efforts.
- Zero direct evidence linking UNREC to Blackstone’s operations.
