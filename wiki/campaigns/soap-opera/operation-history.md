## Operation Ingress

### Brief

BSG personnel have barely set foot on Santa Arcadian soil when they receive their first task—an RLOG cargo ship pilot, Gabriel Moreno, has gone missing after making a scheduled offload at the derelict port town of La Rochelle. Known for its decaying infrastructure and whispered cartel presence, La Rochelle has seen a sharp rise in crime. Last contact with Moreno indicated he felt threatened by a group of unidentified individuals near the docks, and he has since gone dark. BSG teams are to deploy immediately, locate Moreno, assess threats in the area, and extract him safely. Use of force is authorized only if met with direct hostility.

### Outcome

Following a firefight with local cartel forces in La Rochelle, Gabriel Moreno was not located at the scene. Intelligence suggests he was captured by Los Zetas and transported to George Town, where he is being held for ransom. Amid an escalating shootout between cartel enforcers and local police in the city center—further complicated by proximity of Russian mob elements and IS-aligned extremists—BSG is reassigned to execute a high-risk extraction. Despite the chaos and heavy resistance, BSG successfully extracts Moreno and returns him safely to RLOG headquarters.

## Operation Tidal

### Brief 

Operation Tidal is a covert offensive targeting multiple cartel weapons caches across Santa Arcadia. Officially, the mission is presented as a routine RLOG asset protection and infrastructure security sweep, giving BSG the legal cover to operate aggressively in cartel-held areas. Unofficially, the operation is sanctioned by the CIA, using the RLOG contract as a front to dismantle Los Zetas’ supply chain without triggering a political crisis.

The mission requires precision, speed, and plausible deniability. BSG teams are to locate and neutralize high-value arms stockpiles, gather intel on supply routes, and avoid drawing attention to foreign involvement. Any cartel resistance is to be eliminated with minimal collateral damage, and all captured materials must be documented and quietly passed on to Agency liaison embedded within RLOG’s logistics division.

This operation marks a shift from defensive posturing to targeted disruption—and will test BSG’s ability to strike hard while staying off the radar.

### Outcome

Bailiff operatives escorted RLOG personnel to Santa Arcadia International Airport. During the movement, BSG came under light fire from a passing cartel technical. Local police forces provided support, helping repel the attack. Sporadic gunfire was audible in the distance throughout the operation.

Once the airport was secured, BSG operatives departed in an unmarked van en route to a known cartel drone dead drop. At the site, cartel members were neutralized, a cocaine stash was detonated, and a laptop was recovered. A Bailiff detachment transported the laptop back to the extraction vehicle before advancing into the jungle to regroup. During this movement, one operative triggered a mine.

Bailiff forces prioritized response to the mine strike before continuing toward the cartel weapons cache. While regrouping, the detachment engaged and eliminated a two-man cartel scouting party. After successfully regrouping, the Bailiff squad assaulted and destroyed the Los Zetas arms cache, facing heavy infantry resistance. A Santa Arcadian army gunship provided air support during the squad’s withdrawal to the extraction point.

The mission's primary objective—the destruction of the arms cache—was achieved. However, Los Zetas reportedly possess anecdotal accounts of armed individuals seen emerging from the treeline during the engagement.

## Operation Papercut

### Brief

Following the limited success of Operation Tidal, intelligence recovered from cartel weapons sites has revealed the name **El Carpintero** — a high-ranking Los Zetas enforcer rumored to run forced disappearances and maintain territorial control through brutal coercion. Recent spikes in missing persons reports may be linked to a suspected “chop house” operation under his command, though the exact location remains unknown.

The objective is to locate and confirm the existence of a suspected cartel-operated chop shop, believed to be run by El Carpintero. Recent spikes in missing persons reports, coupled with intercepted communications, suggest the site may serve both as a torture chamber and a warning to those who resist cartel control. While official documentation classifies the operation as a routine asset inspection and infrastructure check, in reality, this mission is sanctioned by a third party to gather actionable intel on one of Los Zetas’ most feared figures. BSG operators must move with caution through dense jungle terrain, avoiding detection while surveying suspected locations. The goal is to confirm the chop shop’s location, identify patterns of cartel movement, and report findings for future direct action. Engagements are to be avoided unless absolutely necessary—this is a ghost mission.

### Outcome

Operation Papercut was a success. The RLOG fuel truck was safely delivered to BSG Landlord squad, and BSG Bailiff began their operation to scout and locate cartel chop houses in the area. During the mission, intelligence came in that El Carpintero, a high-ranking Los Zetas enforcer, was in the vicinity.

The squad successfully avoided most cartel patrols and breached a heavily guarded cartel compound, which was identified as a chop house. Inside, the team discovered a gruesome scene: a kill room with blood splattered across the floor, and a body hung in the corner in a disturbing display. The victim's remains had clearly been used as a form of torture and execution, a signature of El Carpintero's twisted methods.

In addition to the scene, BSG recovered a chilling note — a written message to a family member of a recent victim. The note described in excruciating detail the victim’s fate at El Carpintero's hands, and warned that the recipient was next. The note also mentioned the making of a “human chair” — a grotesque piece of furniture crafted from the remains of the victim, which would be sent to their family.

El Carpintero was apprehended alive, though he sustained multiple shrapnel and bullet wounds during the breach. While attempting to extract him, cartel forces launched a pursuit on both BSG squads. The BSG convoy engaged the pursuers and managed to break contact, retreating back to RLOG HQ without further casualties.
