## Season 1

### 1. Operation Ingress

#### Brief

BSG personnel have barely set foot on Santa Arcadian soil when they receive their first task—an RLOG cargo ship pilot, Gabriel Moreno, has gone missing after making a scheduled offload at the derelict port town of La Rochelle. Known for its decaying infrastructure and whispered cartel presence, La Rochelle has seen a sharp rise in crime. Last contact with Moreno indicated he felt threatened by a group of unidentified individuals near the docks, and he has since gone dark. BSG teams are to deploy immediately, locate Moreno, assess threats in the area, and extract him safely. Use of force is authorized only if met with direct hostility.

#### Outcome

Following a firefight with local cartel forces in La Rochelle, Gabriel Moreno was not located at the scene. Intelligence suggests he was captured by Los Zetas and transported to George Town, where he is being held for ransom. Amid an escalating shootout between cartel enforcers and local police in the city center—further complicated by proximity of Russian mob elements and IS-aligned extremists—BSG is reassigned to execute a high-risk extraction. Despite the chaos and heavy resistance, BSG successfully extracts Moreno and returns him safely to RLOG headquarters.

### 2. Operation Tidal

#### Brief 

Operation Tidal is a covert offensive targeting multiple cartel weapons caches across Santa Arcadia. Officially, the mission is presented as a routine RLOG asset protection and infrastructure security sweep, giving BSG the legal cover to operate aggressively in cartel-held areas. Unofficially, the operation is sanctioned by the CIA, using the RLOG contract as a front to dismantle Los Zetas’ supply chain without triggering a political crisis.

The mission requires precision, speed, and plausible deniability. BSG teams are to locate and neutralize high-value arms stockpiles, gather intel on supply routes, and avoid drawing attention to foreign involvement. Any cartel resistance is to be eliminated with minimal collateral damage, and all captured materials must be documented and quietly passed on to Agency liaison embedded within RLOG’s logistics division.

This operation marks a shift from defensive posturing to targeted disruption—and will test BSG’s ability to strike hard while staying off the radar.

#### Outcome

Bailiff operatives escorted RLOG personnel to Santa Arcadia International Airport. During the movement, BSG came under light fire from a passing cartel technical. Local police forces provided support, helping repel the attack. Sporadic gunfire was audible in the distance throughout the operation.

Once the airport was secured, BSG operatives departed in an unmarked van en route to a known cartel drone dead drop. At the site, cartel members were neutralized, a cocaine stash was detonated, and a laptop was recovered. A Bailiff detachment transported the laptop back to the extraction vehicle before advancing into the jungle to regroup. During this movement, one operative triggered a mine.

Bailiff forces prioritized response to the mine strike before continuing toward the cartel weapons cache. While regrouping, the detachment engaged and eliminated a two-man cartel scouting party. After successfully regrouping, the Bailiff squad assaulted and destroyed the Los Zetas arms cache, facing heavy infantry resistance. A Santa Arcadian army gunship provided air support during the squad’s withdrawal to the extraction point.

The mission's primary objective—the destruction of the arms cache—was achieved. However, Los Zetas reportedly possess anecdotal accounts of armed individuals seen emerging from the treeline during the engagement.

### 3. Operation Papercut

#### Brief

Following the limited success of Operation Tidal, intelligence recovered from cartel weapons sites has revealed the name **El Carpintero** — a high-ranking Los Zetas enforcer rumored to run forced disappearances and maintain territorial control through brutal coercion. Recent spikes in missing persons reports may be linked to a suspected “chop house” operation under his command, though the exact location remains unknown.

The objective is to locate and confirm the existence of a suspected cartel-operated chop shop, believed to be run by El Carpintero. Recent spikes in missing persons reports, coupled with intercepted communications, suggest the site may serve both as a torture chamber and a warning to those who resist cartel control. While official documentation classifies the operation as a routine asset inspection and infrastructure check, in reality, this mission is sanctioned by a third party to gather actionable intel on one of Los Zetas’ most feared figures. BSG operators must move with caution through dense jungle terrain, avoiding detection while surveying suspected locations. The goal is to confirm the chop shop’s location, identify patterns of cartel movement, and report findings for future direct action. Engagements are to be avoided unless absolutely necessary—this is a ghost mission.

#### Outcome

Operation Papercut was a success. The RLOG fuel truck was safely delivered to BSG Landlord squad, and BSG Bailiff began their operation to scout and locate cartel chop houses in the area. During the mission, intelligence came in that El Carpintero, a high-ranking Los Zetas enforcer, was in the vicinity.

The squad successfully avoided most cartel patrols and breached a heavily guarded cartel compound, which was identified as a chop house. Inside, the team discovered a gruesome scene: a kill room with blood splattered across the floor, and a body hung in the corner in a disturbing display. The victim's remains had clearly been used as a form of torture and execution, a signature of El Carpintero's twisted methods.

In addition to the scene, BSG recovered a chilling note — a written message to a family member of a recent victim. The note described in excruciating detail the victim’s fate at El Carpintero's hands, and warned that the recipient was next. The note also mentioned the making of a “human chair” — a grotesque piece of furniture crafted from the remains of the victim, which would be sent to their family.

El Carpintero was apprehended alive, though he sustained multiple shrapnel and bullet wounds during the breach. While attempting to extract him, cartel forces launched a pursuit on both BSG squads. The BSG convoy engaged the pursuers and managed to break contact, retreating back to RLOG HQ without further casualties.

### 4. Operation Cuckoo

#### Brief

RLOG suspects that several of its warehouse and office staff have been coerced into working with the Los Zetas cartel. Due to concerns about compromised law enforcement, RLOG has requested a direct intervention by BSG, under the terms of our security contract.

Bailiff squad is tasked with sweeping the RLOG regional office and adjacent warehouse facility. The operation begins with a full data sweep of the office server room—this is the top priority. Once the office is secured, Bailiff is to move on the warehouse and search for evidence of cartel activity, including contraband, documents, or smuggling infrastructure.

This operation is fully sanctioned by RLOG and falls within the scope of our contract. Plausible deniability is not required. Expect hostile resistance if any compromised staff or cartel-affiliated personnel are present on-site.

#### Outcome
Operation Cuckoo was a limited success. BSG Bailiff squad was tasked with sweeping a suspected compromised RLOG office and adjacent warehouse facility. The team successfully secured the office and copied all data from the server room before moving on to the warehouse, where two pallets of cartel-linked cocaine were found and confiscated. The contraband was handed off to Landlord squad at St. George Airstrip.

As breaching operations began, hostile dock workers armed with MAC-10s engaged Bailiff squad, quickly escalating the situation. Cartel QRF soldiers arrived from the tree line and Lijnhaven district, initiating a heavy firefight. A cartel-operated Huey helicopter with a door gunner began circling the warehouse but was neutralized by the armored SUVs’ mounted miniguns.

During the chaos, a rogue element of the local police arrived and, despite warning shots, engaged Bailiff squad. This unexpected hostility has triggered diplomatic friction—Hedgefund has expressed significant concern about the incident and instructed Bailiff to exfil to international waters via helicopter, where they will lay low aboard an RLOG cargo vessel.

### 5. Operation Hardback

#### Brief

Following the events of Operation Cuckoo and the subsequent violent escalation involving rogue police elements, several BSG contractors have been summoned to a closed-door tribunal in George Town. While the situation has been politically delicate, the capture of El Carpintero has proven to be a powerful bargaining chip, resulting in the tribunal's decision to not pursue charges—for now. Your mission begins with providing close protection for the involved BSG personnel as they exit the courthouse. This will be a high-visibility movement through a volatile urban environment. All operatives are required to wear face coverings (sunglass, baseball caps, helmets, balaclavas etc) to conceal identities and mitigate the risk of retaliation or recognition.

Once the tribunal team is escorted to Santa Arcadia International Airport for immediate relocation, BSG is to shift focus to a secondary target: a newly discovered cocaine processing site deep in the southern interior. Intelligence suggests the farm is operated by Los Zetas enforcers and acts as a significant supply hub in their narcotics pipeline. This phase of the mission will involve reconnaissance, documentation, and potential disruption or destruction of cartel infrastructure. Expect resistance and maintain operational flexibility.

This is a two-phase operation:
- High-Risk Close Protection & Extraction
- Jungle Reconnaissance and Cartel Disruption

Maintain discipline, composure, and readiness. This is a show of strength under scrutiny.

#### Outcome

BSG's Bailiff squad carried out a high-risk extraction of contractors from the George Town courthouse following a closed-door tribunal. As the team exited the courthouse, they were harassed by a small group of cartel-affiliated hoodlums who opened fire—standard behavior for the volatile streets of George Town. Bailiff maintained discipline and adhered to strict rules of engagement, choosing not to return fire and focusing solely on the secure and professional evacuation of BSG personnel. The extraction concluded without casualties, and the tribunal team was safely relocated via Santa Arcadia International Airport.

Immediately after, Bailiff was retasked with investigating a rumored drug lab deep within the southern jungles of Santa Arcadia. Intelligence indicated the site could be a critical point in Los Zetas' regional narcotics pipeline. Upon insertion, the team scouted and confirmed cartel activity before launching an assault. Bailiff successfully located and destroyed two cartel arms caches and what appeared to be an active drug production facility. During the operation, a Russian BTR armored vehicle was encountered and neutralized, suggesting growing cartel access to heavy weaponry.

Throughout the mission, Bailiff faced multiple engagements with cartel technicals and dispersed fireteams. Despite persistent resistance, the squad completed all objectives and executed a successful extraction via a hasty landing zone at Bala Airstrip.

### 6. Operation Lovetap

#### Brief

Following the successful capture of El Carpintero, intelligence from a trusted third party indicates a noticeable shift in Los Zetas' operations. With their coercive grip weakened, the cartel is scaling back large-scale coca cultivation and pivoting towards low-profile, mobile production methods. Los Zetas is now relying on micro refinement labs—small, portable setups easily relocated in vans across rural areas of southeastern Santa Arcadia. Once processed, cartel-operated cargo drones are deployed to quickly move cocaine bricks to hidden stash houses, minimizing exposure.

Operation Lovetap is a direct action mission aimed at disrupting this new strategy before it can stabilize. Bailiff squad is tasked with securing this region through aggressive strikes, targeting known and suspected cartel positions, destroying mobile labs, intercepting drone shipments, and denying assets critical to Los Zetas' operations.

RLOG has expressed satisfaction with the recent decline in cartel visibility but wants to ensure this momentum continues. This is an opportunity to tighten the noose—keep the pressure high and force Los Zetas further into survival mode.

#### Outcome

Operation Lovetap achieved decisive results in the southeastern region of Santa Arcadia. Bailiff squad conducted aggressive direct action against Los Zetas’ shifting operations, successfully locating and destroying a fully operational mobile coca refinement lab before it could be relocated.

During the sweep, the squad engaged and neutralized two cartel-operated BTRs, further crippling Los Zetas’ growing reliance on heavy armored assets. Additionally, a narc sub—used for covert maritime transport of cocaine—was discovered hidden along a remote shoreline and was destroyed before it could be deployed.

The operation delivered a significant blow to the cartel’s new micro-production strategy and reinforced BSG’s dominance in the region. With critical assets denied and cartel forces degraded, RLOG has expressed strong approval of BSG’s continued pressure on Los Zetas.

Santa Arcadia remains volatile, but for now, the cartel is reeling.

### 7. Operation Jitter

#### Brief

With El Carpintero’s trial underway in George Town, tensions are at breaking point. Los Zetas are desperate to destabilize the city, disrupt proceedings, and strike fear into anyone aligned against them. RLOG’s corporate offices have become a symbol of that alliance—and a prime target.

BSG has been contracted to secure RLOG assets and personnel during this critical period. Bailiff squad will be deployed across multiple roles, including site security, rapid response, and overwatch. A sniper team will be positioned on a nearby high-rise to provide long-range support and threat interdiction.

Complicating matters, an RLOG executive has insisted on remaining in George Town to oversee operations in person. Initial plans to escort him from a secure location back to the RLOG office will be compromised when his transport is destroyed in a targeted attack. Bailiff will be forced to adapt—extracting the executive under fire and holding position within the RLOG office as the city descends into chaos.

Expect cartel hit squads, rogue police elements, and possible vehicle-borne IEDs. What begins as a defensive posture will escalate into a fight for survival until reinforcements arrive or the situation burns out.

#### Outcome

Landlord squad established a defensive perimeter around the RLOG office in George Town, securing key intersections and forming a triangle of control points. A sniper team deployed to the office rooftop provided overwatch with a .50 caliber platform, effectively neutralizing incoming threats before they could reach the main squad’s positions.

The situation escalated rapidly when the executive transport SUV was destroyed by a suspected IED en route to the office. With the extraction compromised, Hedgefund made the call to convert the mission into a static defense, prioritizing the protection of the RLOG executive as cartel and police forces clashed across the city. Tensions peaked when a police helicopter was shot down by a cartel-fired IGLA shoulder-launched missile, signaling the deployment of heavy weapons within the urban battlespace.

Throughout the engagement, Landlord held firm against waves of cartel assaults, including RPG teams and technicals. The sniper team’s overwatch proved critical in thinning enemy numbers and disabling advancing vehicles.

A key moment came when cartel figurehead "El Zorro" was spotted livestreaming himself gunning down police officers from a BTR. Landlord swiftly engaged and eliminated the target, delivering a decisive blow to cartel morale.

Once hostilities subsided and cartel forces withdrew, the RLOG executive was safely escorted to Santa Arcadia International Airport without further incident.

Operation Jitter was a success, showcasing BSG’s ability to adapt under pressure and dominate in urban defense against a heavily armed opponent.

### 8. Operation Sundown

#### Brief

The final days of BSG’s current contract with RLOG are drawing to a close. With most objectives met and cartel activity significantly reduced, BSG personnel are off duty, gathered for a beachside sendoff hosted by RLOG. The atmosphere is relaxed—drinks, jetskis, and the quiet hum of demobilization. Sidearms are carried, but morale is high.

But peace doesn’t last in Santa Arcadia.

#### Outcome

The post-campaign beach gathering was violently interrupted when a cartel hit squad launched a surprise attack against off-duty BSG contractors. Armed only with sidearms at the outset, BSG personnel quickly rallied, repelling the initial assault and seizing cartel AR platforms from downed enemies. Using RHIBs stationed on the beach, Bailiff squad successfully exfiltrated to a nearby Santa Arcadian Navy warship.

Upon regrouping and rearming aboard the vessel, Bailiff was briefed on an emerging crisis: El Carpintero, who had been broken out of custody during the chaos of Operation Jitter, was orchestrating a hostage situation at the Santa Arcadia Sugar Factory. A high-value RLOG executive had been captured and was being held under direct threat.

Bailiff squad was redeployed immediately. After fighting through remaining cartel resistance at the industrial site, they breached the main warehouse at the sugar factory in an attempt to rescue the hostage. Tragically, the RLOG VIP had been strapped into a bomb vest, and despite Bailiff’s rapid action, the device was detonated during the rescue attempt, resulting in the VIP’s death and one BSG contractor.

During the engagement, Stop-Loss, the supporting helicopter element, sustained a critical engine hit and crash-landed nearby. Bailiff squad diverted mid-mission, locating and extracting the downed pilot under hostile conditions. After securing the crash site and neutralizing pursuing cartel forces, Bailiff squad returned to Santa Arcadia International Airport for immediate exfiltration out of country.

## Season 2

### 1. Operation Redwake

#### Brief

Sweep Blue Pearl Industrial Port—investigate suspicious after-hours movement and unmanifested cargo; support local authorities in clearing La Rochelle of a heavy cartel presence and locate the shipment they believe is being held there (one hostage has already been taken); optionally, if time and assets permit, clear or mark the reported landmines near Lakatoro; finally, pick up the Redshift Logistics executive Victor Salazar at Santa Arcadia International Airport and escort him to secure staging.

#### Outcome

Bailiff squad successfully secured Blue Pearl Industrial Port, clearing the area after reports of suspicious late-night activity and unmanifested cargo. The team then redeployed to La Rochelle, where they engaged in multiple firefights alongside local police to eliminate entrenched cartel forces. During the sweep, Bailiff discovered and secured a weapons cache on the northern edge of town, turning it over to the SAPD cordon. One cartel cargo drone was observed launching from the site and managed to escape before it could be intercepted.

Following the engagement, Bailiff conducted a sweep of the Lakatoro minefield, locating and safely disarming a single tripwire land mine. With the area stabilized, the squad re-armed and mobilized a convoy to Santa Arcadia International Airport to retrieve RLOG executive Victor Salazar. En route, Hedgefund received word that Mr. Salazar had, in true RLOG fashion, ditched his transport and taken an Uber to a nightclub in George Town’s DMZ.

Bailiff located the inebriated executive, secured him without further incident, and escorted him back to BSG headquarters at Blue Pearl Industrial Port, where he was placed in a holding cell “for his own safety”—and to sleep it off.

Operation Redwake concluded successfully, though Hedgefund has since added a new clause to all RLOG escort contracts: “VIPs are not to self-deploy via civilian rideshare services.”

### 2. Operation Deadeye

#### Brief

After the chaos in La Rochelle, law enforcement has passed intel suggesting a senior cartel enforcer has taken shelter in a fortified property in the town of Nicolet. Surveillance indicates light movement around the compound, consistent with a night shift skeleton crew—but the presence of hard targets is likely.

Tonight, you’ll be conducting a covert night raid on the property. Capture is preferred—the police Meatwagon is standing by to process and detain any individuals pulled from the site. Expect close-quarters combat.

This isn’t just a cleanup job. This is a probe. We’re testing their reaction time, communications, and fallback procedures.

After the raid, regroup at BSG HQ for rapid analysis of captured intel and follow-on assignments.

#### Outcome

Bailiff conducted a successful night raid on the cartel safehouse in Nicolet, securing the compound after close-quarters fighting and recovering a cartel-issued phone along with a weapons cache hidden within the property. As cartel reinforcements attempted to retake the site, Bailiff held their ground until local police units arrived to secure the crime scene and begin processing detainees.

Following the raid, Bailiff remained on-call to support unfolding police operations. The squad was dispatched to investigate a suspected cartel stockpile near the George Town DMZ, where they uncovered and seized an uparmoured technical fitted with a BMP turret, turning it over to SAPD.

Later that day, Bailiff responded to a violent cartel-police engagement in Tanouka, where fighting escalated after cartel forces deployed a mortar team and a helicopter gunship. Bailiff stabilized the situation, evacuated civilians, and held the line until Santa Arcadian military forces arrived to establish a full cordon.

Operation Deadeye concluded with multiple cartel assets neutralized, critical intel secured, and BSG reaffirming its role as the island’s decisive rapid-response element.

### 3. Operation Long Lens

#### Brief

We’ve received a customer tip that a representative from Zhenhua Capital may be meeting with Los Zetas, and we need photographic proof—this is strictly an intelligence-gathering mission. The representative’s accommodation is already marked on the map. However, a more urgent situation has developed: SAPD has engaged cartel shooters on the northern edge of Georgetown, outside the DMZ, after Los Zetas sent a hit squad to eliminate a key witness in an upcoming investigation. Due to this escalation, launchers and special equipment are now authorised everywhere outside the DMZ, but must remain stowed while inside it—ROE in the DMZ remains unchanged: only fire if fired upon. Bailiff is to move into George Town, secure a perimeter around the RLOG offices, and stand by to support if authorities request escalation. Audit will provide transport to Santa Arcadia International Airport to improve response time. Index now has night-time tasking authority for fixed-wing UAV surveillance. Hedgefund retains overall command; Bailiff leads ground operations with Broker acting as JTAC.

#### Outcome

During daylight hours, Bailiff responded to SAPD’s call for assistance in northern George Town, helping suppress a cartel crew engaged in a sustained firefight just outside the DMZ. Shortly afterward, the team was tasked with investigating reports of armoured vehicles operating in Nicolet; two PKM-mounted trucks engaged Bailiff on arrival, and both cartel crews were neutralised. Bailiff then returned to the RLOG offices to await further intelligence on the Zhenhua Capital representative.

As night fell, Bailiff was greenlit to begin the reconnaissance phase. A two-man infiltration element breached the perimeter of Zhenhua Capital’s Georgetown compound, placing covert trackers on executive vehicles. The main squad split into two elements to tail the suspected HVT, setting up surveillance outside his hotel before shadowing him on foot into the slums beyond the DMZ. Bailiff held the perimeter until Hedgefund authorised entry, then cleared a small cartel presence inside the shanty town—discovering a drug lab, which was subsequently turned over to SAPD. The Zhenhua Capital mark slipped away amid the chaos, escaping in an SUV and leaving the district.

Index launched and maintained eyes-on via the vehicle tracker, leading Bailiff to Labota. Thermal scans revealed activity in dense woodland southwest of the settlement. Bailiff moved in, made contact with a cartel patrol, and after a brief firefight raided a hidden cartel drug encampment. Inside, the team discovered drug-processing equipment, cartel drone platforms, notes, and a significant weapons cache. Upon exiting the site with the recovered intel, Escrow was called in to conduct an airstrike on the encampment, finalising the destruction of cartel infrastructure in the area.

Operation Long Lens concluded with multiple cartel assets dismantled, valuable intelligence secured, and clear confirmation that Zhenhua Capital is involved in deeper, covert dealings across Santa Arcadia.

### 4. Operation Raincrow 

#### Brief

Bailiff is on-call to support local police as cartel violence continues to flare across Santa Arcadia. Maintain readiness to respond to SAPD escalation requests anywhere outside the Georgetown DMZ while Hedgefund coordinates a developing intelligence picture. We are awaiting a greenlight for a reconnaissance sweep on a suspected cartel coca farm located in the southern interior—if recon confirms active production or guard presence, Bailiff will immediately transition into a full raid to dismantle the site, secure any intel, and deny the cartel further use of the area. Stay mobile, stay discreet, and be prepared to pivot from police support to jungle offensive at a moment’s notice.

#### Outcome

Operation Raincrow escalated rapidly from routine on-call support to a multi-stage engagement across Santa Arcadia. Bailiff was ambushed immediately after leaving Blue Pearl Industrial Port, forcing the squad to defend and then escort a BPI port van out of the kill zone. A second ambush followed shortly after, resulting in the death of a Blue Pearl staff member caught in the crossfire. En route to Santa Arcadia International Airport, BSG came under sniper fire, but successfully delivered the van to the airport for safekeeping.

Moments later, Bailiff was diverted to a police emergency at the Diesel Power Plant, where cartel forces had seized the facility. BSG established overwatch, scouted enemy positions, and moved in for a close-quarters assault against heavily equipped cartel fighters. During the engagement, cartel operatives detonated several generators, causing significant power loss across the region. A police backup vehicle arriving to assist was destroyed by a remote-controlled car bomb before it reached the cordon.

Following the firefight, Bailiff withdrew to the airport to prepare for the next phase of the operation. The squad then conducted a preliminary reconnaissance sweep of the suspected coca farm location near Baluvu, confirming cartel activity before extracting aboard Audit, the transport helicopter, in preparation for the full raid to come.
