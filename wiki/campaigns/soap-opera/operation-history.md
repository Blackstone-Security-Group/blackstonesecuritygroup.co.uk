## Season 1

### 1. Operation Ingress

#### Brief

BSG personnel have barely set foot on Santa Arcadian soil when they receive their first task—an RLOG cargo ship pilot, Gabriel Moreno, has gone missing after making a scheduled offload at the derelict port town of La Rochelle. Known for its decaying infrastructure and whispered cartel presence, La Rochelle has seen a sharp rise in crime. Last contact with Moreno indicated he felt threatened by a group of unidentified individuals near the docks, and he has since gone dark. BSG teams are to deploy immediately, locate Moreno, assess threats in the area, and extract him safely. Use of force is authorized only if met with direct hostility.

#### Outcome

Following a firefight with local cartel forces in La Rochelle, Gabriel Moreno was not located at the scene. Intelligence suggests he was captured by Los Zetas and transported to George Town, where he is being held for ransom. Amid an escalating shootout between cartel enforcers and local police in the city center—further complicated by proximity of Russian mob elements and IS-aligned extremists—BSG is reassigned to execute a high-risk extraction. Despite the chaos and heavy resistance, BSG successfully extracts Moreno and returns him safely to RLOG headquarters.

### 2. Operation Tidal

#### Brief 

Operation Tidal is a covert offensive targeting multiple cartel weapons caches across Santa Arcadia. Officially, the mission is presented as a routine RLOG asset protection and infrastructure security sweep, giving BSG the legal cover to operate aggressively in cartel-held areas. Unofficially, the operation is sanctioned by the CIA, using the RLOG contract as a front to dismantle Los Zetas’ supply chain without triggering a political crisis.

The mission requires precision, speed, and plausible deniability. BSG teams are to locate and neutralize high-value arms stockpiles, gather intel on supply routes, and avoid drawing attention to foreign involvement. Any cartel resistance is to be eliminated with minimal collateral damage, and all captured materials must be documented and quietly passed on to Agency liaison embedded within RLOG’s logistics division.

This operation marks a shift from defensive posturing to targeted disruption—and will test BSG’s ability to strike hard while staying off the radar.

#### Outcome

Bailiff operatives escorted RLOG personnel to Santa Arcadia International Airport. During the movement, BSG came under light fire from a passing cartel technical. Local police forces provided support, helping repel the attack. Sporadic gunfire was audible in the distance throughout the operation.

Once the airport was secured, BSG operatives departed in an unmarked van en route to a known cartel drone dead drop. At the site, cartel members were neutralized, a cocaine stash was detonated, and a laptop was recovered. A Bailiff detachment transported the laptop back to the extraction vehicle before advancing into the jungle to regroup. During this movement, one operative triggered a mine.

Bailiff forces prioritized response to the mine strike before continuing toward the cartel weapons cache. While regrouping, the detachment engaged and eliminated a two-man cartel scouting party. After successfully regrouping, the Bailiff squad assaulted and destroyed the Los Zetas arms cache, facing heavy infantry resistance. A Santa Arcadian army gunship provided air support during the squad’s withdrawal to the extraction point.

The mission's primary objective—the destruction of the arms cache—was achieved. However, Los Zetas reportedly possess anecdotal accounts of armed individuals seen emerging from the treeline during the engagement.

### 3. Operation Papercut

#### Brief

Following the limited success of Operation Tidal, intelligence recovered from cartel weapons sites has revealed the name **El Carpintero** — a high-ranking Los Zetas enforcer rumored to run forced disappearances and maintain territorial control through brutal coercion. Recent spikes in missing persons reports may be linked to a suspected “chop house” operation under his command, though the exact location remains unknown.

The objective is to locate and confirm the existence of a suspected cartel-operated chop shop, believed to be run by El Carpintero. Recent spikes in missing persons reports, coupled with intercepted communications, suggest the site may serve both as a torture chamber and a warning to those who resist cartel control. While official documentation classifies the operation as a routine asset inspection and infrastructure check, in reality, this mission is sanctioned by a third party to gather actionable intel on one of Los Zetas’ most feared figures. BSG operators must move with caution through dense jungle terrain, avoiding detection while surveying suspected locations. The goal is to confirm the chop shop’s location, identify patterns of cartel movement, and report findings for future direct action. Engagements are to be avoided unless absolutely necessary—this is a ghost mission.

#### Outcome

Operation Papercut was a success. The RLOG fuel truck was safely delivered to BSG Landlord squad, and BSG Bailiff began their operation to scout and locate cartel chop houses in the area. During the mission, intelligence came in that El Carpintero, a high-ranking Los Zetas enforcer, was in the vicinity.

The squad successfully avoided most cartel patrols and breached a heavily guarded cartel compound, which was identified as a chop house. Inside, the team discovered a gruesome scene: a kill room with blood splattered across the floor, and a body hung in the corner in a disturbing display. The victim's remains had clearly been used as a form of torture and execution, a signature of El Carpintero's twisted methods.

In addition to the scene, BSG recovered a chilling note — a written message to a family member of a recent victim. The note described in excruciating detail the victim’s fate at El Carpintero's hands, and warned that the recipient was next. The note also mentioned the making of a “human chair” — a grotesque piece of furniture crafted from the remains of the victim, which would be sent to their family.

El Carpintero was apprehended alive, though he sustained multiple shrapnel and bullet wounds during the breach. While attempting to extract him, cartel forces launched a pursuit on both BSG squads. The BSG convoy engaged the pursuers and managed to break contact, retreating back to RLOG HQ without further casualties.

### 4. Operation Cuckoo

#### Brief

RLOG suspects that several of its warehouse and office staff have been coerced into working with the Los Zetas cartel. Due to concerns about compromised law enforcement, RLOG has requested a direct intervention by BSG, under the terms of our security contract.

Bailiff squad is tasked with sweeping the RLOG regional office and adjacent warehouse facility. The operation begins with a full data sweep of the office server room—this is the top priority. Once the office is secured, Bailiff is to move on the warehouse and search for evidence of cartel activity, including contraband, documents, or smuggling infrastructure.

This operation is fully sanctioned by RLOG and falls within the scope of our contract. Plausible deniability is not required. Expect hostile resistance if any compromised staff or cartel-affiliated personnel are present on-site.

#### Outcome
Operation Cuckoo was a limited success. BSG Bailiff squad was tasked with sweeping a suspected compromised RLOG office and adjacent warehouse facility. The team successfully secured the office and copied all data from the server room before moving on to the warehouse, where two pallets of cartel-linked cocaine were found and confiscated. The contraband was handed off to Landlord squad at St. George Airstrip.

As breaching operations began, hostile dock workers armed with MAC-10s engaged Bailiff squad, quickly escalating the situation. Cartel QRF soldiers arrived from the tree line and Lijnhaven district, initiating a heavy firefight. A cartel-operated Huey helicopter with a door gunner began circling the warehouse but was neutralized by the armored SUVs’ mounted miniguns.

During the chaos, a rogue element of the local police arrived and, despite warning shots, engaged Bailiff squad. This unexpected hostility has triggered diplomatic friction—Hedgefund has expressed significant concern about the incident and instructed Bailiff to exfil to international waters via helicopter, where they will lay low aboard an RLOG cargo vessel.

### 5. Operation Hardback

#### Brief

Following the events of Operation Cuckoo and the subsequent violent escalation involving rogue police elements, several BSG contractors have been summoned to a closed-door tribunal in George Town. While the situation has been politically delicate, the capture of El Carpintero has proven to be a powerful bargaining chip, resulting in the tribunal's decision to not pursue charges—for now. Your mission begins with providing close protection for the involved BSG personnel as they exit the courthouse. This will be a high-visibility movement through a volatile urban environment. All operatives are required to wear face coverings (sunglass, baseball caps, helmets, balaclavas etc) to conceal identities and mitigate the risk of retaliation or recognition.

Once the tribunal team is escorted to Santa Arcadia International Airport for immediate relocation, BSG is to shift focus to a secondary target: a newly discovered cocaine processing site deep in the southern interior. Intelligence suggests the farm is operated by Los Zetas enforcers and acts as a significant supply hub in their narcotics pipeline. This phase of the mission will involve reconnaissance, documentation, and potential disruption or destruction of cartel infrastructure. Expect resistance and maintain operational flexibility.

This is a two-phase operation:
- High-Risk Close Protection & Extraction
- Jungle Reconnaissance and Cartel Disruption

Maintain discipline, composure, and readiness. This is a show of strength under scrutiny.

#### Outcome

BSG's Bailiff squad carried out a high-risk extraction of contractors from the George Town courthouse following a closed-door tribunal. As the team exited the courthouse, they were harassed by a small group of cartel-affiliated hoodlums who opened fire—standard behavior for the volatile streets of George Town. Bailiff maintained discipline and adhered to strict rules of engagement, choosing not to return fire and focusing solely on the secure and professional evacuation of BSG personnel. The extraction concluded without casualties, and the tribunal team was safely relocated via Santa Arcadia International Airport.

Immediately after, Bailiff was retasked with investigating a rumored drug lab deep within the southern jungles of Santa Arcadia. Intelligence indicated the site could be a critical point in Los Zetas' regional narcotics pipeline. Upon insertion, the team scouted and confirmed cartel activity before launching an assault. Bailiff successfully located and destroyed two cartel arms caches and what appeared to be an active drug production facility. During the operation, a Russian BTR armored vehicle was encountered and neutralized, suggesting growing cartel access to heavy weaponry.

Throughout the mission, Bailiff faced multiple engagements with cartel technicals and dispersed fireteams. Despite persistent resistance, the squad completed all objectives and executed a successful extraction via a hasty landing zone at Bala Airstrip.

### 6. Operation Lovetap

#### Brief

Following the successful capture of El Carpintero, intelligence from a trusted third party indicates a noticeable shift in Los Zetas' operations. With their coercive grip weakened, the cartel is scaling back large-scale coca cultivation and pivoting towards low-profile, mobile production methods. Los Zetas is now relying on micro refinement labs—small, portable setups easily relocated in vans across rural areas of southeastern Santa Arcadia. Once processed, cartel-operated cargo drones are deployed to quickly move cocaine bricks to hidden stash houses, minimizing exposure.

Operation Lovetap is a direct action mission aimed at disrupting this new strategy before it can stabilize. Bailiff squad is tasked with securing this region through aggressive strikes, targeting known and suspected cartel positions, destroying mobile labs, intercepting drone shipments, and denying assets critical to Los Zetas' operations.

RLOG has expressed satisfaction with the recent decline in cartel visibility but wants to ensure this momentum continues. This is an opportunity to tighten the noose—keep the pressure high and force Los Zetas further into survival mode.

#### Outcome

Operation Lovetap achieved decisive results in the southeastern region of Santa Arcadia. Bailiff squad conducted aggressive direct action against Los Zetas’ shifting operations, successfully locating and destroying a fully operational mobile coca refinement lab before it could be relocated.

During the sweep, the squad engaged and neutralized two cartel-operated BTRs, further crippling Los Zetas’ growing reliance on heavy armored assets. Additionally, a narc sub—used for covert maritime transport of cocaine—was discovered hidden along a remote shoreline and was destroyed before it could be deployed.

The operation delivered a significant blow to the cartel’s new micro-production strategy and reinforced BSG’s dominance in the region. With critical assets denied and cartel forces degraded, RLOG has expressed strong approval of BSG’s continued pressure on Los Zetas.

Santa Arcadia remains volatile, but for now, the cartel is reeling.

### 7. Operation Jitter

#### Brief

With El Carpintero’s trial underway in George Town, tensions are at breaking point. Los Zetas are desperate to destabilize the city, disrupt proceedings, and strike fear into anyone aligned against them. RLOG’s corporate offices have become a symbol of that alliance—and a prime target.

BSG has been contracted to secure RLOG assets and personnel during this critical period. Bailiff squad will be deployed across multiple roles, including site security, rapid response, and overwatch. A sniper team will be positioned on a nearby high-rise to provide long-range support and threat interdiction.

Complicating matters, an RLOG executive has insisted on remaining in George Town to oversee operations in person. Initial plans to escort him from a secure location back to the RLOG office will be compromised when his transport is destroyed in a targeted attack. Bailiff will be forced to adapt—extracting the executive under fire and holding position within the RLOG office as the city descends into chaos.

Expect cartel hit squads, rogue police elements, and possible vehicle-borne IEDs. What begins as a defensive posture will escalate into a fight for survival until reinforcements arrive or the situation burns out.

#### Outcome

Landlord squad established a defensive perimeter around the RLOG office in George Town, securing key intersections and forming a triangle of control points. A sniper team deployed to the office rooftop provided overwatch with a .50 caliber platform, effectively neutralizing incoming threats before they could reach the main squad’s positions.

The situation escalated rapidly when the executive transport SUV was destroyed by a suspected IED en route to the office. With the extraction compromised, Hedgefund made the call to convert the mission into a static defense, prioritizing the protection of the RLOG executive as cartel and police forces clashed across the city. Tensions peaked when a police helicopter was shot down by a cartel-fired IGLA shoulder-launched missile, signaling the deployment of heavy weapons within the urban battlespace.

Throughout the engagement, Landlord held firm against waves of cartel assaults, including RPG teams and technicals. The sniper team’s overwatch proved critical in thinning enemy numbers and disabling advancing vehicles.

A key moment came when cartel figurehead "El Zorro" was spotted livestreaming himself gunning down police officers from a BTR. Landlord swiftly engaged and eliminated the target, delivering a decisive blow to cartel morale.

Once hostilities subsided and cartel forces withdrew, the RLOG executive was safely escorted to Santa Arcadia International Airport without further incident.

Operation Jitter was a success, showcasing BSG’s ability to adapt under pressure and dominate in urban defense against a heavily armed opponent.
