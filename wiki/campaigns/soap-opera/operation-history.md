## Operation Ingress

### Brief

BSG personnel have barely set foot on Santa Arcadian soil when they receive their first task—an RLOG cargo ship pilot, Gabriel Moreno, has gone missing after making a scheduled offload at the derelict port town of La Rochelle. Known for its decaying infrastructure and whispered cartel presence, La Rochelle has seen a sharp rise in crime. Last contact with Moreno indicated he felt threatened by a group of unidentified individuals near the docks, and he has since gone dark. BSG teams are to deploy immediately, locate Moreno, assess threats in the area, and extract him safely. Use of force is authorized only if met with direct hostility.

### Outcome

Following a firefight with local cartel forces in La Rochelle, Gabriel Moreno was not located at the scene. Intelligence suggests he was captured by Los Zetas and transported to George Town, where he is being held for ransom. Amid an escalating shootout between cartel enforcers and local police in the city center—further complicated by the involvement of Russian mob elements and IS-aligned extremists—BSG is reassigned to execute a high-risk extraction. Despite the chaos and heavy resistance, BSG successfully extracts Moreno and returns him safely to RLOG headquarters.
