## Operation Ingress

### Brief

BSG personnel have barely set foot on Santa Arcadian soil when they receive their first task—an RLOG cargo ship pilot, Gabriel Moreno, has gone missing after making a scheduled offload at the derelict port town of La Rochelle. Known for its decaying infrastructure and whispered cartel presence, La Rochelle has seen a sharp rise in crime. Last contact with Moreno indicated he felt threatened by a group of unidentified individuals near the docks, and he has since gone dark. BSG teams are to deploy immediately, locate Moreno, assess threats in the area, and extract him safely. Use of force is authorized only if met with direct hostility.

### Outcome

Following a firefight with local cartel forces in La Rochelle, Gabriel Moreno was not located at the scene. Intelligence suggests he was captured by Los Zetas and transported to George Town, where he is being held for ransom. Amid an escalating shootout between cartel enforcers and local police in the city center—further complicated by proximity of Russian mob elements and IS-aligned extremists—BSG is reassigned to execute a high-risk extraction. Despite the chaos and heavy resistance, BSG successfully extracts Moreno and returns him safely to RLOG headquarters.

## Operation Tidal

### Brief 

Operation Tidal is a covert offensive targeting multiple cartel weapons caches across Santa Arcadia. Officially, the mission is presented as a routine RLOG asset protection and infrastructure security sweep, giving BSG the legal cover to operate aggressively in cartel-held areas. Unofficially, the operation is sanctioned by the CIA, using the RLOG contract as a front to dismantle Los Zetas’ supply chain without triggering a political crisis.

The mission requires precision, speed, and plausible deniability. BSG teams are to locate and neutralize high-value arms stockpiles, gather intel on supply routes, and avoid drawing attention to foreign involvement. Any cartel resistance is to be eliminated with minimal collateral damage, and all captured materials must be documented and quietly passed on to Agency liaison embedded within RLOG’s logistics division.

This operation marks a shift from defensive posturing to targeted disruption—and will test BSG’s ability to strike hard while staying off the radar.

### Outcome

Bailiff operatives escorted RLOG personnel to Santa Arcadia International Airport. During the movement, BSG came under light fire from a passing cartel technical. Local police forces provided support, helping repel the attack. Sporadic gunfire was audible in the distance throughout the operation.

Once the airport was secured, BSG operatives departed in an unmarked van en route to a known cartel drone dead drop. At the site, cartel members were neutralized, a cocaine stash was detonated, and a laptop was recovered. A Bailiff detachment transported the laptop back to the extraction vehicle before advancing into the jungle to regroup. During this movement, one operative triggered a mine.

Bailiff forces prioritized response to the mine strike before continuing toward the cartel weapons cache. While regrouping, the detachment engaged and eliminated a two-man cartel scouting party. After successfully regrouping, the Bailiff squad assaulted and destroyed the Los Zetas arms cache, facing heavy infantry resistance. A Santa Arcadian army gunship provided air support during the squad’s withdrawal to the extraction point.

The mission's primary objective—the destruction of the arms cache—was achieved. However, Los Zetas reportedly possess anecdotal accounts of armed individuals seen emerging from the treeline during the engagement.
