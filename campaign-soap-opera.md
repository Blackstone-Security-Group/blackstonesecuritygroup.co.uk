# The Republic of Tanoa

Tanoa is a strategically located island nation off the coast of Colombia and Ecuador, serving as a maritime crossroads between South America, North America, and Europe, with key trade routes extending into Asia. While the government fights to maintain a legitimate economy, the Los Zetas cartel holds significant influence over its black-market trade, forcing corporations like Redshift Logistics (RLOG) to navigate a delicate balance between profit, security, and survival.

Recently, tensions escalated when an RLOG cargo crew was taken hostage while docked in port, prompting RLOG to ramp up its private security presence. In response, Blackstone Security Group (BSG) has been contracted to ensure the safety of RLOG personnel and assets, preventing future cartel interference.

RLOG, a rapidly expanding shipping giant, has only been operating in Tanoa for a few years, but its growing port infrastructure has drawn the attention of cartels who see its logistics network as a potential smuggling route or lucrative extortion target. While RLOG remains clean, the threat of cartel coercion looms large, placing BSG in a constant high-alert security posture.

## Economic Backbone – How Does Tanoa Stay Independent?

Despite its small size, Tanoa thrives economically due to its shipping industry, offshore banking sector, natural resources, and industrial exports, though all of these come with a level of political risk.

### The Shipping & Logistics Industry – The Rise of RLOG

- **Strategic Shipping Hub** – Tanoa sits on key maritime routes, making it an ideal point for refueling, resupplying, and redirecting cargo between continents.
- **Blue Pearl Industrial Port** – The largest port in Tanoa, crucial for RLOG’s operations and a growing target for cartel influence and smuggling attempts.
- **RLOG’s Expansion** – Over the last few years, RLOG has aggressively built up Tanoa’s port infrastructure, becoming a dominant force in container shipping, freight forwarding, and cargo security.
- **Road & Rail Connections** – A small-gauge railway and direct road links between the port and Red Springs Surface Mine allow for efficient resource transport and export.
- **BSG’s Role in RLOG’s Protection** – BSG has been contracted to ensure that cartel activity does not bleed into RLOG’s supply chain.
- **Tensions with the Cartels** – Los Zetas want access to RLOG’s infrastructure, and while RLOG has remained clean, the threat of cartel coercion, bribery, or sabotage is always present.

### Fishing & Maritime Trade – The Old Industry vs. The New

Tanoa’s coastal waters are rich with marine life, and fishing has long been its primary industry. However, the rise of large-scale logistics companies like RLOG has displaced many small fishing operations.

- **Local Fishing Industry** – The island exports tuna, snapper, and shrimp, with large fishing fleets supplying international markets.
- **Cartel Influence on Fishing** – Many independent fishermen are forced to smuggle drugs or act as lookouts for cartel operations in exchange for protection.
- **Conflict Between Old & New Money** – Traditional fishing villages resent RLOG’s expansion, seeing it as the beginning of the corporatization of their waters.
- **Smuggling via Fishing Boats** – Cartels conceal narcotics in fishing vessels, using them as cover for trafficking operations. BSG patrols must differentiate between legitimate trade and cartel activity.

### Industrial & Energy Sector

Tanoa has a growing industrial sector, supported by natural resource extraction and energy production.

- **Red Springs Surface Mine** – A key site for mineral extraction, exporting raw materials via Blue Pearl Industrial Port.
- **Tanoa Sugar Company** – A major employer, producing sugar and ethanol, with logistical dependencies on both port and rail networks.
- **Lumber Industry** – The island has a significant timber trade, with logging operations supporting both domestic use and export.
- **Diesel Power Plant** – The primary energy provider, critical for industrial and commercial operations, making it a potential target for sabotage or cartel influence.

### Offshore Banking & Shell Corporations

- **Tanoa’s lax financial regulations** make it a haven for offshore banking, where foreign investors store wealth anonymously.
- **International corporations, corrupt politicians, and even cartel bosses** use Tanoa as a financial loophole to move funds without scrutiny.
- **The government benefits from this system**, as it attracts wealth while avoiding complete dependence on drug money or international trade.

## The Political Landscape – A Government Walking the Line

The government of Tanoa is not entirely corrupt, but not entirely clean either. It struggles to maintain independence while dealing with foreign pressure, internal crime, and economic instability.

### 1. The Tanoan Government – Legitimacy vs. Survival

- **The President** – A publicly elected leader, but one who must balance corporate interests, cartel threats, and international diplomacy to stay in power.
- **Police & National Guard** – Underfunded and frequently bribed or intimidated by cartels, leaving private security firms like BSG to fill the security gap.
- **Judicial Corruption** – The legal system is unreliable, often favoring those with money, influence, or cartel protection.
- **Pressure from the U.S. & Colombia** – Both nations suspect Tanoa of harboring drug operations, but so far, the government has avoided direct accusations.

### 2. Military Strength & Security Forces

Tanoa maintains a small but capable military force focused on coastal defense and counter-cartel operations.

- **Tanoan Navy** – A single aging warship patrols the island’s surrounding waters to deter piracy and drug trafficking.
- **Air Force** – Operates two older fighter jets, used primarily for air patrols and quick response to cartel incursions.
- **Army & National Guard** – Stationed at the **Northwest Military Base**, the island’s main military installation, providing security for key infrastructure and assisting in counter-cartel operations.

## The Gray Areas – BSG’s Role in the Conflict

### BSG’s Mission Objectives

BSG has been hired to protect RLOG, not police the country. However, the blurry lines between corporate security, cartel threats, and government interests make the job increasingly difficult.

- **Defend RLOG’s shipments & infrastructure** – Ensuring that cartels do not infiltrate their supply chain.
- **Prevent Cartel Encroachment Without Direct Confrontation** – Engaging with Los Zetas could escalate tensions beyond corporate security boundaries.
- **Support Government Forces Discreetly** – While officially neutral, BSG teams may have to covertly assist law enforcement to ensure stability.
- **Monitor Fishing Trade for Cartel Influence** – Differentiating between legitimate fishermen and cartel-aligned smugglers is a constant challenge.
- **Avoid Political Fallout** – If RLOG is seen as too close to the government or foreign interests, it could lead to nationalist backlash or political sabotage.

## The Ticking Time Bomb – What Comes Next?

Tanoa is at a boiling point, and BSG’s presence might be the tipping factor:

- Will Los Zetas escalate attacks against RLOG & BSG?
- Can the government stabilize before foreign powers intervene?
- Will RLOG’s success threaten cartel control, or will it be forced to compromise?
- Can BSG remain neutral, or will it be forced to take a side?

With tensions rising and no clear resolution in sight, Tanoa is set to become a battleground of shifting alliances, corporate power struggles, and cartel warfare—an endless cycle of conflict ready to ignite at any moment.
