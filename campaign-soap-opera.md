## Background

Santa Arcadia is a strategically located island nation off the coast of Colombia and Ecuador, serving as a maritime crossroads between South America, North America, and Asia. Its economy thrives on maritime trade, commercial fishing, and the expanding operations of Redshift Logistics (RLOG), a major shipping company that has established itself as the dominant logistical provider in the region over the past few years.

Santa Arcadia has managed to maintain its independence due to its strategic importance in global trade and a delicate balancing act between international partnerships and internal stability. The island was historically a colonial outpost before gaining independence in the mid-20th century. Since then, it has navigated complex diplomatic waters, leveraging its prime location to remain a neutral ground for trade and commerce.

The nation's government is a fragile democracy, rife with corruption and external pressures. While it maintains official ties with regional powers and international organizations, much of the island's administration operates in a grey zone where business interests, criminal elements, and political maneuvering overlap.

Fishing is one of Santa Arcadia’s oldest and most vital industries, providing employment to a large portion of the population. However, illegal fishing, overfishing, and maritime crime have put stress on the sector, with local fishermen often caught between cartel influence and foreign corporate interests. This industry also serves as a convenient cover for smuggling operations, further complicating law enforcement efforts.

## Conflict

Los Zetas, a ruthless and well-funded drug cartel, have entrenched themselves within Santa Arcadia, using the island as a key hub for cocaine production and smuggling. They exploit the intricate trade networks to move narcotics via shipping containers, narco-subs, and covert maritime routes. Their influence extends beyond the ports, reaching into law enforcement, politics, and even local businesses, making them a formidable presence on the island.

Although RLOG is a legitimate company, the growing cartel influence in the region has raised concerns about potential infiltration and coercion. RLOG leadership, recognizing the risk to their personnel and operations, has contracted Blackstone Security Group (BSG) to provide security for their assets, port facilities, and shipments. The tension escalated when an RLOG crew was taken hostage by the cartel while docked in port, prompting a ramp-up in BSG’s presence on the island.

## Government Involvement

While BSG's official mandate is to protect RLOG interests, its contract has also created opportunities for government agencies to leverage its presence for covert operations. These agencies see Santa Arcadia as the perfect staging ground for more aggressive anti-cartel missions under the guise of protecting corporate assets. Intelligence operatives, special forces, and law enforcement task forces may operate under the umbrella of RLOG’s security contract, conducting missions that range from targeted assassinations to counter-smuggling operations.

The government of Santa Arcadia itself remains divided—some officials see BSG’s presence as a stabilizing force against cartel activity, while others, influenced or outright controlled by Los Zetas, see it as a threat to their interests. The island’s small but underfunded military and police forces struggle to maintain order, often finding themselves either complicit in criminal activities or caught in the crossfire.

## Escalation & Endless Conflict

Los Zetas will continuously adapt, recruit, and escalate their operations, while BSG must hold the line and push back wherever possible. The cartel will shift tactics, using guerrilla warfare, bribery, and terror tactics to maintain their grip.

RLOG, while clean in its operations, constantly faces the looming threat of being forced into illicit activities under cartel pressure. Meanwhile, government agencies operating alongside BSG will push for more aggressive intervention, increasing tensions with local authorities and further muddying the waters of legitimacy.

This dynamic ensures that the campaign can be revisited whenever needed, functioning as an ongoing conflict akin to a British soap opera—always evolving, with new threats, shifting alliances, and opportunities for high-intensity operations.

### The Republic of Santa Arcadia – Economic & Political Landscape

Santa Arcadia is a **strategically located island nation** off the coast of **Colombia and Ecuador**, serving as a **maritime crossroads between South America, North America, and Europe**, with key trade routes extending into **Asia**. While the government fights to maintain a **legitimate economy**, the **Los Zetas cartel** holds significant influence over its black-market trade, forcing corporations like **Redshift Logistics (RLOG)** to navigate a delicate balance between profit, security, and survival.

Recently, tensions escalated when an **RLOG cargo crew was taken hostage while docked in port**, prompting RLOG to **ramp up its private security presence**. In response, **Blackstone Security Group (BSG) has been contracted to ensure the safety of RLOG personnel and assets, preventing future cartel interference**.

RLOG, a **rapidly expanding shipping giant**, has only been operating in Santa Arcadia for a few years, but its growing port infrastructure has drawn the **attention of cartels** who see its logistics network as a **potential smuggling route or lucrative extortion target**. While RLOG remains clean, the **threat of cartel coercion looms large**, placing BSG in a **constant high-alert security posture**.

## Economic Backbone – How Does Santa Arcadia Stay Independent?

- **Smuggling via Fishing Boats** – Cartels **conceal narcotics in fishing vessels**, using them as cover for trafficking operations. **BSG patrols must differentiate between legitimate trade and cartel activity.**

### Offshore Banking & Shell Corporations

## The Gray Areas – BSG’s Role in the Conflict
