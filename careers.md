					<h3>Forward Operations</h3>
				</header>
				<p>
					Surveying and gathering intelligence on the enemy can take many forms, and BSG aims to cover that broad demographic to the best extent. Forming anything from a forward recon element, understanding the picture of a hostile threat from afar, to covert HUMINT operations hiding in plain sight, we understand the importance of intelligence to mission success:
					<ul>
					    <li>Conducting covert surveillance and reconnaissance missions to assess potential threats.</li>
					    <li>Deploying in both urban and remote settings to gather actionable intelligence.</li>
					    <li>Performing HUMINT (Human Intelligence) operations, blending into environments while maintaining a low profile.</li>
					    <li>Supporting special operations teams with real-time situational awareness and target analysis.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Close Protection & Static Security</h3>
				</header>
				<p>
          Staying pure to the origin of the Private Security Contractors that we loosely base ourselves off of, many forms of security are the backbone of what we pride ourselves on. We strive to provide an adept and flexible security force. Our security teams are responsible for:
					<ul>
					    <li>Providing executive protection to high-profile individuals, government officials, and corporate leaders.</li>
					    <li>Safeguarding critical infrastructure, embassies, and private properties from potential threats.</li>
					    <li>Implementing and managing access control, entry-point security, and threat deterrence.</li>
					    <li>Conducting risk assessments and security planning to mitigate threats in volatile environments.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Logistical Support</h3>
				</header>
				<p>
					Our bread and butter in JTOs, a rigid supply pipeline is often overlooked during mission planning, and that's a gap that BSG is always aiming to fill. Keeping personnel in the fight at any level is something we'll always commit to, and do so in an efficient, professional manner. Our Logistical Support teams ensure seamless operations through:
					<ul>
					    <li>Secure transportation of personnel, supplies, and sensitive equipment in high-risk areas.</li>
					    <li>Coordinating supply routes, warehousing, and distribution of critical materials.</li>
					    <li>Providing sustainment operations to support deployed personnel in hostile environments.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Aviation</h3>
				</header>
				<p>
					Aerial support plays a crucial role in modern security operations, and BSG integrates aviation assets to enhance operational reach and effectiveness. Our Aviation teams are involved in:
					<ul>
					    <li>Piloting and maintaining fixed-wing and rotary aircraft for transport, reconnaissance, and rapid deployment.</li>
					    <li>Conducting aerial surveillance and intelligence-gathering missions.</li>
					    <li>Providing emergency evacuation and medical airlift capabilities.</li>
